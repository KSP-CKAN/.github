        If someone has already reported the issue you're having, then we already know about it and don't need another report.
        If you read the discussion of the existing report, you can often find advice for how to work around problems, so it's worth checking.
        If it's closed, then that means we've already investigated and fixed it!
        Check the recent issues (especially the ones pinned to the top!) to see if your issue has already been reported before submitting a new one:
